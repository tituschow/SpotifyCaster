# SpotifyCaster
This was a fun weekend project to stream and cast songs from Spotify. It was born out of frustration with Spotify's lack of Chromecast support and the unstable alternatives.

Run server.py and connect to 127.0.0.1:5000. The server's IP address is currently hardcoded - that probably needs to be changed.

This wasn't designed to be a super clean and professional, but it works.
